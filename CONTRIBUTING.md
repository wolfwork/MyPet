## Bug reports

A bug is a _problem_ that is caused by MyPet.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed**

3. **Include everything that helps to determine the problem** &mdash; See example below.


A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What Server version and OS
experience the problem? Do other builds show the bug differently? What
would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix
any potential bugs.

> merits).
